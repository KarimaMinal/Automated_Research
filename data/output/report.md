### An Optimal Control View of Adversarial Machine Learning
 An optimal control view of adversarial machine learning is defined by the adversary's goals to do harm and be hard to detect . The view includes test-item attacks, training-data poisoning, and adversarial reward-shaping . This view encourages researchers to utilize advances in control theory and reinforcement learning .

### Towards Modular Machine Learning Solution Development: Benefits and Trade-offs
 Machine learning technologies play a key role in the success of modern businesses . Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solveunique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of machine learning technologies . We explore the benefits of modular machine learning . solutions and discuss how modular machine . learning solutions can overcome some of the major engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning. solutions .

### A Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology, Part I: Traditional Machine Learning
 University classes on machine learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required to become a meteorologist . The lack of formal instruction has contributed to the perception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users are hesitant to apply the methods in their every day workflow .

### Position Paper: Towards Transparent Machine Learning
 The goal of this project is to enable direct human understanding of machine learning models, giving us the ability to learn, verify, and refine them as programs . Transparent machine learning is introduced as an alternative form of machinelearning, where both the model and the learning system are represented in source code form .

### Understanding Bias in Machine Learning
 Bias is known to be an impediment to fair decisions in many domains such as human resources, the public sector, health care etc. At the same time, machine learning experts warn that machine learning models can be biased as well . In this article, our goal is to explain the issue of bias in machine learning from a technical perspective .
